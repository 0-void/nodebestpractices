> Often, programmers will use RegEx to validate that an input received from a user conforms to an expected condition. A vulnerable Regular Expression is known as one which applies repetition to a repeating capturing group, and where the string to match is composed of a suffix of a valid matching pattern plus characters that aren't matching the capturing group.

From the blog [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)
> "But HTML entity encoding doesn't work if you're putting untrusted data inside a <script> tag anywhere, or an event handler attribute like onmouseover, or inside CSS, or in a URL. So even if you use an HTML entity encoding method everywhere, you are still most likely vulnerable to XSS. You MUST use the escape syntax for the part of the HTML document you're putting untrusted data into."
