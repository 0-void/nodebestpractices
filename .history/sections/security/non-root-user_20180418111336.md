# Run Node as Noon-Root User

### One Paragraph Explainer
minimize permissions, most web app doesn't need root. If root the creativity spectrum is enornous,consider re-routing traffic... Many Docker users run as-root unintenioally, other do. If you're not using Docker - no worries, Node won't run as root unless you explicitly ask. If you do use Docker (e.g. Swarm, Kubernetes), use user (example)


### Code example - Building a Docker image as noon-root
```javascript
```

From the Repository docker-node by [eyalzek](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/master/docs/BestPractices.md#non-root-user):
> By default, Docker runs container as root which inside of the container can pose as a security issue. You would want to run the container as an unprivileged user wherever possible. The node images provide the node user for such purpose. The Docker Image can then be run with the node user in the following way:

-u "node"

From the blog docker-node by [eyalzek](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/master/docs/BestPractices.md#non-root-user):
> Indeed, if you are running your server as root and it gets hacked through a vulnerability in your code, the attacker will have total control over your machine. This means the attacker could potentially wipe out your whole disk or worse. On the other hand, if your server runs with the permissions of a regular user, the attacker will be limited by those permissions.
