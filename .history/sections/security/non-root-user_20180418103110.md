# Run Node as Noon-Root User

### One Paragraph Explainer
minimize permissions, most web app doesn't need root. If root the creativity spectrum is enornous,consider re-routing traffic... 


### Code example - Building a Docker image as noon-root
```javascript
// example of malicious code which an attacker was able to input
userInput = "require('child_process').spawn('rm', ['-rf', '/'])";
// malicious code executed
eval(userInput);
```

### What other bloggers say
From the Essential Node.js Security book by [Liran Tal](https://leanpub.com/nodejssecurity):
> The eval() function is perhaps of the most frowned upon JavaScript pieces from a security
perspective. It parses a JavaScript string as text, and executes it as if it were a JavaScript code.
Mixing that with untrusted user input that might find itâ€™s way to eval() is a recipe for disaster that
can end up with server compromise.
