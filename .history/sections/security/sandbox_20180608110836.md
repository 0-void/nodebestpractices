# Run Node.js as Non-Root User

### One Paragraph Explainer
As a rule of thumb, one should run his own JS files only. Theories aside, real-world   scenarios demand to execute JS files that are being passed dynamically at run-time. For example, consider a dynamic framework like WebPack that accepts custom loaders and execute those dynamically during build time. In the existence of some malicious plugin we wish to minimize the damage and maybe even let the flow terminate successfully - this requires to run the plugins in a sandbox environment that is fully isolated in terms of resources, error handling and the information we share with that sandbox. Three main options can help in achieving this isolation: (1) a dedicated child process - this provides a quick information isolation but demand to tame the child process, limit its execution time and recover from errors (2) a cloud serverless framework ticks all the sandbox requirements but deployment and invoking a FaaS function dynamically is not a walk in the part (3) (https://www.npmjs.com/package/sandbox)[some NPM libraries] allow 1 single line of code to run custom JS code in isolation. Though this latter option wins in simplicity it provides a limited protection

### Code example - Using Sandbox library to 
```javascript
FROM node:latest
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
USER node
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### What other bloggers say
From the Repository docker-node by [eyalzek](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/master/docs/BestPractices.md#non-root-user):
> By default, Docker runs container as root which inside of the container can pose as a security issue. You would want to run the container as an unprivileged user wherever possible. The node images provide the node user for such purpose. The Docker Image can then be run with the node user in the following way:

-u "node"

From the blog Don't run Node.js as root by [Olivier Lalonde](http://syskall.com/dont-run-node-dot-js-as-root/):
> Indeed, if you are running your server as root and it gets hacked through a vulnerability in your code, the attacker will have total control over your machine. This means the attacker could potentially wipe out your whole disk or worse. On the other hand, if your server runs with the permissions of a regular user, the attacker will be limited by those permissions.

From the blog Developing Secure Node.js Applications — A Broad Guide by [Deepal Jayasekara](https://jsblog.insiderattack.net/developing-secure-node-js-applications-a-broad-guide-286afdec69ce):
> Never run Node.js as root. Running node.js as root will make it worse if an attacker somehow gains control over your application. In this scenario, attacker would also gain root privileges which could result in a catastrophe. If you need to run your application on port 80 or 443, you can do port forwarding using iptables or you can place a front-end proxy such as nginx or apache which routes request from port 80 or 443 to your application
