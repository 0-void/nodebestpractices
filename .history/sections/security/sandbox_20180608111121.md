# Run Node.js as Non-Root User

### One Paragraph Explainer
As a rule of thumb, one should run his own JS files only. Theories aside, real-world   scenarios demand to execute JS files that are being passed dynamically at run-time. For example, consider a dynamic framework like WebPack that accepts custom loaders and execute those dynamically during build time. In the existence of some malicious plugin we wish to minimize the damage and maybe even let the flow terminate successfully - this requires to run the plugins in a sandbox environment that is fully isolated in terms of resources, error handling and the information we share with that sandbox. Three main options can help in achieving this isolation: (1) a dedicated child process - this provides a quick information isolation but demand to tame the child process, limit its execution time and recover from errors (2) a cloud serverless framework ticks all the sandbox requirements but deployment and invoking a FaaS function dynamically is not a walk in the part (3) (https://www.npmjs.com/package/sandbox)[some NPM libraries] allow 1 single line of code to run custom JS code in isolation. Though this latter option wins in simplicity it provides a limited protection

### Code example - Using Sandbox library to run code in isolation
```javascript
const Sandbox = require("sandbox")
  , s = new Sandbox()

s.run( "lol)hai", function( output ) {
  console.log(output);
  //output='Synatx error'
});

// Example 4 - Restricted code
s.run( "process.platform", function( output ) {
  console.log(output);
  //output=Null
})

// Example 5 - Infinite loop
s.run( "while (true) {}", function( output ) {
  console.log(output);
  //output='Timeout'
})
```

From the Repository docker-node by [eyalzek](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/master/docs/BestPractices.md#non-root-user):
> By default, Docker runs container as root which inside of the container can pose as a security issue. You would want to run the container as an unprivileged user wherever possible. The node images provide the node user for such purpose. The Docker Image can then be run with the node user in the following way:

-u "node"
