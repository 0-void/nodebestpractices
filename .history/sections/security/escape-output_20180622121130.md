### Blog Quote: "OWASP recommends using a security-focused encoding library"
From the blog [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)
> "Writing these encoders is not tremendously difficult, but there are quite a few hidden pitfalls. For example, you might be tempted to use some of the escaping shortcuts like \" in JavaScript. However, these values are dangerous and may be misinterpreted by the nested parsers in the browser. You might also forget to escape the escape character, which attackers can use to neutralize your attempts to be safe. **OWASP recommends using a security-focused encoding library to make sure these rules are properly implemented**."

### Book Quote: "A vulnerable Regular Expression is known as one which applies repetition"
From the book [Essential Node.js Security](https://leanpub.com/nodejssecurity) by Liran Tal
> Often, programmers will use RegEx to validate that an input received from a user conforms to an expected condition. A vulnerable Regular Expression is known as one which applies repetition to a repeating capturing group, and where the string to match is composed of a suffix of a valid matching pattern plus characters that aren't matching the capturing group.

### Blog Quote: "You MUST use the escape syntax for the part of the HTML"
From the blog [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)
> "But HTML entity encoding doesn't work if you're putting untrusted data inside a <script> tag anywhere, or an event handler attribute like onmouseover, or inside CSS, or in a URL. So even if you use an HTML entity encoding method everywhere, you are still most likely vulnerable to XSS. You MUST use the escape syntax for the part of the HTML document you're putting untrusted data into."
