# Current Tasks

Welcome to the preliminary tasks collection for the Node.js best practices project. In the following document, you can find all kinds of tasks related to improving this repository content- and code-wise!

## Continuous Integration

To scale with our community, we discussed implementing CI-based tooling into our main workflows, including the automated review of contributions to assess quality automatically and fix common mistakes with ease.

### Grammar & language optimization using automated tooling

**Status**: Pending refinement

**Assigned to**: [Sagir Khan (sagirk)](https://github.com/sagirk)

By utilizing existing tools like [proselint](https://github.com/amperser/proselint), we might be able to automate the review of a contribution's content without having to assign a human for manually finding common mistakes.

### Publishing Node.js best practices to external sources

**Status**: [Built prototype (proof of concept)](https://github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices/pull/296)

**Assigned to**: [Joe Reeve (@ISNIT0)](https://github.com/ISNIT0)

Using tools to snapshot pages to PDF and generate web pages based on our Markdown content, we are planning to distribute our best practices to additional platforms other than our GitHub repository.

## Usage of and transition to TypeScript code examples

**Status**: Pending refinement

**Assigned to**: [Bruno Scheufler (@BrunoScheufler)](https://github.com/BrunoScheufler)

Since TypeScript's adoption is rising faster than ever, we are planning to include code examples based on TypeScript in our content sections, maybe even by transitioning from our vanilla JavaScript examples.

## Introducing a news/changelog section at the top of our repository

**Status**: Pending refinement

**Assigned to**: [@idori](https://github.com/idori)

Since the main source of project news, other than the issue section, currently is our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/nodepractices), we've decided to prepend a short section to our main README, which is the place most of our visitors will access.
