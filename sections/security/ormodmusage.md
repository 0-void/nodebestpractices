# Preventing database injection vulnerabilities by using ORM/ODM libraries or other DAL packages

### One Paragraph Explainer

When creating your database logic you should watch out for eventual injection vectors that could be exploited by potential attackers. Writing database queries manually or not including data validation for user requests are the easiest methods to allow for these vulnerabilities. This situation is however easy to avoid when you use suitable packages for validating input and handling database operations. In many cases your system will be safe and sound by using a validation library like
[joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) or [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) and an ORM/ODM from the list below. This should guarantee the use of parameterized queries and data bindings to ensure the validated data is properly escaped and handled without opening unwanted attack vectors. Many of these libraries will ease your life as a developer by enabling many useful features like not having to write complex queries manually, supplying types for language-based type systems or converting data types to wanted formats. To conclude, __always__ validate any data you are going to store and use proper data-mapping libraries to handle the dangerous work for you.
